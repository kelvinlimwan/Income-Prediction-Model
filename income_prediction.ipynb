You can use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. \n",

While the main focus is on correctness of your methods, you will lose marks if your code is not understandable.\n",

However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the University’s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place.\n"

    "(a) The full NB classifier performs best because it captures all the features and uses them to predict the labels. In contrast, the continuous and binary NB classifiers only use a fraction of the features to predict the labels. The full NB classifier is the most informative and results in the highest accuracy and F1 score since it has the most data points (features).\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Accuracy puts more emphasis on the true positives and true negatives in the dataset whereas F1 score captures the false postivies and false negatives more. Accuracy is more informative when the class distribution is similar while F1 score is a better metric when there are imbalanced classes in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) The higher the F1 score, the less likely will the bank manager falsely grant a loan to an applicant. A more suitable metric is the False Positive Rate. It computes the ratio of false positives to the number of incorrectly labelled instances. Hence it would highlight the rate of falsely granting a loan rather than also highlighting the rate of falsely not granting a loan (false negative), which is what the F1 score captures.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) For this dataset, the full NB classifier outperforms the LR model by a small margin. They both use the same number of parameters (104- the number of features) but their model assumptions differ. NB will likely outperform LR if there is a small training data since NB is based on the joint density function whereas LR estimates may overfit the data. For these same reasons, LR will likely outperform NB for a large training data. Since the binary features are broken down into one-hot-representation in the Adult dataset, the features are most likely conditionally independent, and hence NB outperforms LR even though the dataset is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Assume that the training and test data sets come from the same empirical data and there is no outlier in the data. With an infinitely large dataset, the loss function of a LR model will be completely (optimally) minimised. Hence, the LR coefficients will be 100% accurate and will achieve perfect test set performance. This is not true if the training and test data sets come from distinct empirical data or there are outliers in the data. A NB classifier still won't achieve perfect results because of it's strong assumption on conditional independence which doesn't disappear over large data."
